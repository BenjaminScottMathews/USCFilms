# USCFilms
This is an iPhone app developed using SwiftUI to search films and tv shows of interest.

I completed this project while pursuing my Masters at the University of Southern California. 

Through the development of this project, I gained experience with SwiftUI, Alamofire api requests, Kingfisher photo displays, SwiftyJSON parsing and GCP to deploy an app which allows users to query the TMDB api to receive movie and tv show data, add those results to a persistent watchlist, and discover what media is currently trending.

Enjoy!
